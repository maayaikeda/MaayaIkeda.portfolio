## Project 1: [YouTube trend analysis](https://github.com/maayaikeda/Youtube_trend_analysis)
Videos that are on YouTube trending page changes everyday and it is a reflection of what is happening in the world and the popular topics people are discussing at the time. At the time of this analysis, democratic and republican national convention just happened and the trailer for the new Batman movie was released.
I analyzed data from 4 English speaking countries (US, Australia, Canada, Great Britan) in detail to see what kinds of videos and channels are trending at this time (08/26/2020-09/04/2020). The analysis gives us insights into how to publish videos on Youtube to go on the trending page.

## Project 2: [New York State race, arrest, and prison sentence analysis](https://github.com/maayaikeda/newyork_crime)
I analyzed the New York State 2018 arrest data to see if racial disparities exist. Analysis included adjusting for county population data and racial demographics of counties in which persons were arrested or sentenced to prison. I found that black people are arrested and sentenced to prison disproportionately high compared to every other demographic group. This is true especially for counties with high white population (>50%). Conversely, in counties where black people make up more than 10% of the total population black people are arrested less and yield fewer prison sentences per arrest. This suggest that disproportionately high arrest and prison sentences of black people is due to racial biases against black people in counties with high white/ low black population.
